# ML-Classifer-SVM
This code demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for image classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It trains a model on a dataset of labeled images, extracts features from the images, and uses the trained model to predict labels for new test images. In this case we used the datasets to differentiate between dress shirts and t-shirts.
